## About
CO2Tracker is an application used to help young people record their travel carbon emissions, and the software runs on the basis of the Internet.


## Introduction
In this document, we will give the method and some things about how to run the system. First of all, since this system is composed of multiple pages, except for the initial login interface, the rest of the interfaces cannot be directly reached. Therefore, we need to run through the login interface, namely MainActivity.

In addition, the operation of the application needs to rely on a virtual machine or AVD. At the time of design, many XML interfaces are designed to run in these AVDs above pixel2.

In addition, since the application uses the Firebase database, you need to open the Firebase Authentication and Realtime database in Tools before running the software.
